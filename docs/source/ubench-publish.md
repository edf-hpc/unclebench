# NAME


ubench-publish -  Publish results to repository

# SYNOPSIS


    ubench publish -p <platform> -b <bench> [<bench> ...] [-w <W> [<W> ...]]\
    [-c <param>:<new_value> [<param>:<new_value> ...]]

    ubench run -h

# DESCRIPTION


*ubench run*  execute benchmarks with given platform settings.

# OPTIONS


# -p <platform>
  Name of the configuration that provides platform settings needed to run the benchmark.


# -b <bench> [<bench> ...]
  Names of the benchmarks to run.


# -w <W> [<W> ...]
  Nodes on which benchmarks should be run ex: -w 6 cn184 cn[380,431-433] would\
  run the benchmark on three different configurations (6 available nodes, one node\
  named cn184 and four nodes named cn[380,431-433]). You can also launch a job on all idle nodes\
  ex : -w all4 to launch a benchmark with 4 nodes jobs covering every idle node.


# -c <CUSTOMP> [<CUSTOMP> ...]
  Modify a benchmark parameter on command line.\
  ex: -c <benchmark_paramater>:1 would launch a benchmark with <benchmark_parameter> parameter set to 1.
  
# -f <FILE.yaml>
  Modify a benchmark parameter by putting it in a yaml file.\
  ex: -f bench.yaml would launch a benchmark with <benchmark_parameter> parameter set to 1\
  which we can find it in bench.yaml

# -e 
  Perform only the step execute without compilation.\
  Some parameters have to be set using -c or -f such as: executable, binary, input files.
